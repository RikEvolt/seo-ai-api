Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental.[3]

Artificial Intelligence (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
",Artificial Intelligence,"
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field devoted to building
artificial animals (or at least artificial creatures that – in
suitable contexts – appear to be animals) and, for
many, artificial persons (or at least artificial creatures that
– in suitable contexts – appear to be
 persons).[1]
 Such goals immediately ensure that AI is a discipline of considerable
interest to many philosophers, and this has been confirmed (e.g.) by
the energetic attempt, on the part of numerous philosophers, to show
that these goals are in fact un/attainable. On the constructive side,
many of the core formalisms and techniques used in AI come out of, and
are indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-order
logic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modeling
of doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning; inductive logic,
probability theory, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoning
and planning, and so on. In light of this, some philosophers conduct
AI research and development as philosophy. ",https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/,776000000.0,62,16,95

It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).

Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN,[3] but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density. To do so, the points of the database are (linearly) ordered such that spatially closest points become neighbors in the ordering. Additionally, a special distance is stored for each point that represents the density that must be accepted for a cluster so that both points belong to the same cluster. This is represented as a dendrogram.

Convolutional neural network,3,Multilayer perceptron - Wikipedia,Multilayer perceptron,"A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The term MLP is used ambiguously, sometimes loosely to any feedforward ANN, sometimes strictly to refer to networks composed of multiple layers of perceptrons (with threshold activation); see § Terminology. Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""vanilla"" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.[1]

Convolutional neural network,4,Equivariant map - Wikipedia,Equivariant map,"In mathematics, equivariance is a form of symmetry for functions from one space with symmetry to another (such as symmetric spaces). A function is said to be an equivariant map when its domain and codomain are acted on by the same symmetry group, and when the function commutes with the action of the group. That is, applying a symmetry transformation and then computing the function produces the same result as computing the function and then applying the transformation.

However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces[2] and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,[3][4] radial basis-functions,[5] or neural networks with specific properties.[6] Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary width"" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary depth"" case).

The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly and, in many cases, retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships is fast because they are perpetually stored in the database. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making them useful for heavily inter-connected data.[2]

Recurrent neural network,1,Recurrent neural network - Wikipedia,Recurrent neural network,"A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.[1][2][3] This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[4] or speech recognition.[5][6]

Recursive neural networks, sometimes abbreviated as RvNNs, have been successful, for instance, in learning sequence and tree structures in natural language processing, mainly phrase and sentence continuous representations based on word embedding. RvNNs have first been introduced to learn distributed representations of structure, such as logical terms.[1]
Models and general frameworks have been developed in further works since the 1990s.[2][3]

","A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data.

Like feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks utilize training data to learn. They are distinguished by their “memory” as they take information from prior inputs to influence the current input and output. While traditional deep neural networks assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other, the output of recurrent neural networks depend on the prior elements within the sequence.
